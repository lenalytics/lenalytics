### Hi there, welcome to my Github Page 👋

I am a mix of a data analyst, finance nerd and automation engineer. I like to keep things simple, smart and beautiful, and for business that can be the difference between winning and losing.

As an experienced data analyst, I am comfortable working with technologies in the space - Power BI, SQL, Python, Excel, APIs, any nocode tools.

Here's a few posts I wrote for [dev.to](https://dev.to)

- 🚙 [Data behind parking tickets in New York City](https://dev.to/lenalytics/data-behind-parking-tickets-in-new-york-city-23ac)
- 🏠 [Airbnb Properties in Australia](https://dev.to/lenalytics/airbnb-properties-in-australia-2lpg)

I'm best reached via [email](https://lenalytics.me/#contacts). I'm always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
